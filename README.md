## User description
Upon loading, user will see the overview page. On the overview page, user will see a nav bar with links to three other pages, a profile area with a picture and other information, an 'about' area/readme, a container of pinned repos, and a footer. User can exit overview page with links to all of the information on the page, as well as the the pages. In the pinned repos section, user can delete pinned repos. 

When user exits to the respository page from the nav bar, user will see the repository page. On the repository page, user will see repeated information from overview page with a change in the repo section, which now contains unpinned repos. User can sort and search through the repos in this container, as well as star individual repos. This page also contains a new form, in which user can add a repo to the repos container above.

When a user exits the repository page and enters the projects page through the nav bar, user will see repeated information from the two previous pages with changes in the container and form. The container now holds projects that can be deleted and a form that submits new projects.

Upon arriving to the packages page, the user will see a collection of package cards. The user will be able to submit information on the form below. When submitted, the information will go onto a card with the other packages. User may also delete packages. The search bar will filter through package names and hide packages that do not get filtered out.
